I am 3rd year PhD student in the MAC team at LAAS-CNRS under the supervision of [Isabelle Queinnec](https://homepages.laas.fr/queinnec/) and [Luca Zaccarian](https://homepages.laas.fr/lzaccari/).

I received the master's degree in Mechatronics Engineering from the University of Trento, Italy, in 2021, following his bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering in 2018. 

My main research interests include the hybrid systems analysis within the domains of power electronics and mechatronics. I have also worked on the synchronization of multi-agent systems.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically. -->
